        My name is Scott Hillier. I grew up in Ottawa and attended Carleton
        University to earn my undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering.

        There, I was first introduced to coding and after graduating I decided
        to learn more about it and enroll in the Lighthouse Labs web
        developement bootcamp.
