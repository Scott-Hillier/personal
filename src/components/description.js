        My name is Scott Hillier. I attended Carleton University where I earned
        a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering. I was first introduced to
        coding during my time at Carleton. Wanting to improve my skillset, I
        enrolled and completed the Lighthouse Labs web development bootcamp.
