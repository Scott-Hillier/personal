      <p>Hi there, you might be wondering who I am.</p>
      <p>Let me take this opportunity to introduce myself.</p>
      <p>
        My name is Scott Hillier. I grew up in Ottawa and attended Carleton
        University to earn my undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        There, I was first introduced to coding and after graduating I decided
        to learn more about it and enroll in the Lighthouse Labs web
        developement bootcamp.
      </p>
      <p>Here are some of the projects that i've worked on.</p>
