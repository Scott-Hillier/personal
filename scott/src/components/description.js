      <p>
        My name is Scott Hillier. I grew up in Ottawa and attended Carleton
        University and earned my undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        There, I was first introduced to coding and after graduating I decided
        to improve my skillset and enrolled in the Lighthouse Labs web
        development bootcamp.
      </p>
      <p>Here are some of the projects that I've worked on.</p>
